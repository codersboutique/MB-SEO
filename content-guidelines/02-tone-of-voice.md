# Tone of Voice Guidelines

## Overview

Our tone of voice reflects our brand personality: **engineering-minded, direct, data-focused, and authoritative**. We sound like a senior GTM engineer talking to a peer, not a marketer talking to a prospect.

---

## Core Tone Principles

### 1. Technical, Not Jargon-Heavy
We use precise technical language because our audience understands it. But we never use jargon for its own sake.

**✅ Do:** "We integrate signal data from G2, Bombora, and LinkedIn to trigger personalized outreach."
**❌ Don't:** "We leverage synergistic data solutions to optimize your customer journey touchpoints."

### 2. Direct, Not Aggressive
We get to the point. We don't bury the lede. But we're never rude or condescending.

**✅ Do:** "Most agencies measure impressions. We measure pipeline."
**❌ Don't:** "Unlike those other clueless agencies, we actually know what we're doing."

### 3. Data-Backed, Not Boring
We cite numbers, benchmarks, and evidence. But we tell a story with the data.

**✅ Do:** "The average Series A startup takes 8 months to find a repeatable channel. Our clients do it in 3."
**❌ Don't:** "According to industry statistics, optimization of key performance indicators yields enhanced results."

### 4. Authoritative, Not Arrogant
We know our domain deeply. But expertise doesn't mean dismissiveness.

**✅ Do:** "After working with 50+ AI startups, here's what we've learned about AEO."
**❌ Don't:** "Obviously, if you knew anything about SEO, you'd understand why this matters."

### 5. Practical, Not Theoretical
We focus on what works. Theory is fine, but application is required.

**✅ Do:** "Here's the exact n8n workflow we use to route leads based on intent score."
**❌ Don't:** "In theory, a properly designed lead scoring mechanism should inform distribution logic."

## Voice by Context

### Website Copy
- **More formal than Slack, less formal than academic**
- Focus on outcomes and benefits
- Lead with the problem, then the solution
- Use second person ("you") to address the reader

### Blog/Research Content
- **Educational and authoritative**
- Can be longer and more detailed
- Include data, examples, and code snippets
- Write as if explaining to a smart colleague

### LinkedIn Posts
- **Conversational but insightful**
- Hook in the first line (pattern interrupt)
- Personal voice (founder speaking, not brand speaking)
- End with a question or call to engage

### Email (Outbound)
- **Short, direct, personalized**
- Lead with relevance (why them, why now)
- One clear ask per email
- No fluff, no preamble

### Sales Conversations
- **Consultative, not pitchy**
- Ask questions before offering solutions
- Use their language, not ours
- Focus on their pain, not our services

## Sentence Structure Guidelines

### Length
- Aim for 15-20 words per sentence on average
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Break long sentences into multiple shorter ones

### Rhythm
- Vary sentence length for readability
- Use fragments sparingly for emphasis ("No fluff. Just systems.")
- End sections with strong, conclusive statements

### Paragraph Structure
- One idea per paragraph
- Lead with the main point
- 3-5 sentences maximum

---

## Formatting for Clarity

### Use Tables for Comparisons
Tables help readers scan and compare. Use them for:
- Before/After
- Us vs. Them
- Metric breakdowns
- Feature comparisons

### Use Headers Liberally
Headers break up text and enable skimming. Use:
- H2 for major sections
- H3 for subsections
- Bold for inline emphasis

### Use Bullet Points for Lists
When you have 3+ related items, use bullets:
- Easier to scan
- Reduces wall-of-text fatigue
- Creates visual rhythm

## Word Choice

### Power Words We Use
| Word | Context |
|------|---------|
| Engineer | "We engineer growth systems" |
| Build | "We build infrastructure" |
| Automate | "Automate your outbound" |
| Scale | "Scale revenue efficiently" |
| Pipeline | "Generate pipeline, not clicks" |
| Infrastructure | "Revenue infrastructure" |
| Compound | "Systems that compound" |

### Weak Words to Avoid
| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Help | Enable, Build, Create |
| Leverage | Use, Apply |
| Utilize | Use |
| Synergy | (Just delete it) |
| Best-in-class | Best |
| Cutting-edge | Modern |
| World-class | Leading |
| Holistic | Integrated, Full-stack |

---

## Punctuation & Style

### General
- Use serial/Oxford comma: "Clay, Apollo, and Clearbit"
- Em dashes (—) for emphasis, hyphens (-) for compounds
- Quotes for terms being defined: "We call this 'Generative Authority'"
- Parentheses sparingly (they break flow)

### Capitalization
- Sentence case for headlines: "How to build an enrichment waterfall"
- Capitalize our proprietary terms: Generative Authority Framework, Information Gain Protocol
- Don't capitalize generic terms: inbound marketing, lead scoring

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine, use numerals for 10+
- Always use numerals for: percentages, metrics, money, dates
- Example: "We reduced CAC by 40% in 3 months"
