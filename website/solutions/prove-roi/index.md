# Prove ROI to Investors

**Your Board Doesn't Care About Impressions.**

Investors don't wake up thinking about your CPM or email open rates. They care about **CAC, LTV, payback period, and marketing's contribution to pipeline**. If you can't prove—with data—that your marketing spend generates efficient revenue, you're going to have uncomfortable board meetings.

Marketing Boutique builds the attribution infrastructure that translates marketing activity into investor-grade metrics.

## The Attribution Problem for Startups

Most startups suffer from one of two attribution failures:

| Failure Mode | Symptom | Consequence |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **Under-Attribution** | Marketing claims no credit; all wins go to sales | Marketing budget gets cut; team morale drops |
| **Over-Attribution** | Every channel claims full credit | Inflated expectations; wasted spend on ineffective channels |

**The reality:** B2B buying journeys are complex. A single deal might involve 10+ touchpoints across 6 months. Without proper infrastructure, you're guessing.

## Our ROI Proof Services

### 1. Attribution Model Design
We implement the right attribution framework for your sales cycle.

**Model Options:**
- **First-Touch:** Who originated the lead? (Top of funnel)
- **Last-Touch:** What closed the deal? (Bottom of funnel)
- **Multi-Touch:** Weighted credit across the journey (Realistic)
- **W-Shaped:** First, lead creation, and opportunity creation touches weighted (B2B best practice)

### 2. Data Infrastructure
Attribution requires clean, connected data.

**What We Build:**
- **UTM Hygiene:** Standardized tracking parameters across all campaigns.
- **CRM-to-Analytics Connection:** HubSpot/Salesforce data flowing to your analytics tool.
- **Deal Stage Mapping:** Clear definitions of what constitutes an MQL, SQL, and Opportunity.

### 3. Dashboard Development
Investors want to see data, not spreadsheets.

**What We Build:**
- **Executive Dashboard:** CAC by channel, LTV/CAC ratio, payback period.
- **Marketing Contribution Report:** Pipeline and revenue influenced by marketing.
- **Cohort Analysis Views:** How CAC and retention evolve over time.

### 4. Board Deck Support
We help you tell the story your investors need to hear.

**What We Deliver:**
- **Quarterly Marketing Performance Summary:** One-pagers with key metrics.
- **CAC Trend Analysis:** Demonstrating efficiency gains.
- **Pipeline Forecast Models:** Data-driven predictions for next quarter.

## Key Metrics We Help You Track

| Metric | Definition | Why Investors Care |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** | Total marketing + sales cost / new customers | Efficiency of growth engine |
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | Customer lifetime value / CAC | Unit economics health |
| **CAC Payback Period** | Months to recover CAC from gross margin | Cash flow efficiency |
| **Marketing Sourced Pipeline** | Pipeline from marketing-originated leads | Marketing's revenue contribution |
| **Marketing Influenced Revenue** | Revenue where marketing touched the deal | Broader impact measurement |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on our work with [Series A](/solutions/series-a/) and Series B AI companies:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **LTV/CAC Ratio** | >3x |
| **CAC Payback** | <12 months |
| **Marketing Sourced %** | 30-50% of pipeline |
| **Win Rate** | >20% |

If you're below these benchmarks, we identify why and build the infrastructure to improve.
