# Signal-Based Outbound

**Stop Spamming. Start Signaling.**

"Spray and pray" is dead. Google and Yahoo's spam filters have killed bulk outreach. The only way to win in 2026 is **Signal-Based Outbound**—reaching the right person, with the right message, at the exact moment they show intent. We engineer the systems that make this automatic.

## The Problem: The "SDR Grind" is Broken

Hiring junior SDRs to manually send generic emails is expensive, inefficient, and dangerous for your domain reputation.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Generic Lists** | Buying a list of "CEOs in Tech" results in <0.1% reply rates. Everyone has that list. |
| **Volume Over Relevance** | Sending 1,000 bad emails burns your domain. Sending 50 perfect emails builds pipeline. |
| **Manual Research** | SDRs spending 20 minutes researching one prospect is unscalable. AI agents can do it in seconds. |

**The reality:** You don't need more SDRs. You need better data engineering.

## Our Outbound Services

### 1. Waterfall Enrichment (Clay)
We build complex data waterfalls that check multiple providers (Apollo, claiming, [**LinkedIn**](/solutions/paid-user-acquisition/linkedin/)) to find verified contact info with 90%+ coverage.

**What We Build:**
- **Clay Tables:** Automated workflows that ingest leads and enrich them in real-time.
- **Verification Logic:** "Debounce" checks to ensure emails are valid before sending.
- **Persona Filtering:** Automatically disqualifying bad fits before they enter your [**CRM**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/sales-automation/).

### 2. Signal Monitoring
We track buying signals, not just job titles.

**What We Build:**
- **Hiring Triggers:** Alerts when a target company hires a VP of Sales.
- **Funding Alerts:** Outreach triggered by Series A/B announcements.
- **Tech Stack Detection:** Focusing on companies using specific software (e.g., "HubSpot users").

### 3. Deliverability Infrastructure
We build the "plumbing" that keeps your emails out of the spam folder.

**What We Build:**
- **Secondary Domains:** Setting up `getbrand.com` and `trybrand.com` to protect your main domain.
- **DNS Authentication:** Perfect SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.
- **Warmup Pools:** Automated inbox warming to maintain high sender reputation.

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on our client data:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Open Rate** | >45% (if tracking is on) |
| **Positive Reply Rate** | >3-5% |
| **Meetings/Month** | 15-25 per automated seat |

If you're getting <1% replies, your data is bad or your signal is weak.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is cold email illegal?
No, B2B cold email is legal in the US (CAN-SPAM) and compliant in GDPR regions *if* you have a legitimate business interest and offer an opt-out. We build strictly compliant systems.

### Do I need Clay?
For modern outbound, yes. It is the standard for programmable data enrichment. We are Clay experts.

### Will this burn my domain?
No. We never send cold email from your primary domain. We build a dedicated infrastructure of secondary domains that redirect to you, insulating your main brand from risk.
