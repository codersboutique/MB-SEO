# Sales Automation

**Your Sales Team Shouldn't Be Data Entry Clerks.**

The average sales rep spends only 33% of their time selling. The rest? Updating CRMs, finding phone numbers, and writing follow-up emails. **Sales Automation** removes the admin burden so your expensive talent can focus on closing revenue.

## The Problem: CRM Chaos

"If it's not in Salesforce, it didn't happen." But nobody puts it in Salesforce. Manual data entry is slow, inaccurate, and hated by sales teams. [**Automation**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/tech-stack/) fixes this.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Dirty Data** | Duplicate contacts, missing fields, and outdated info make your CRM useless. |
| **Lead Leakage** | Inbound leads sit for hours before being assigned. Speed to lead is critical. |
| **Manual Follow-up** | "Just checking in" emails waste time and get low response rates. |

**The reality:** You are paying high salaries for low-value work. Automation fixes the ROI equation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which CRM do you support?
We specialize in **HubSpot** and **Salesforce**. For early-stage startups, we strongly recommend HubSpot for its ease of automation.

### Can you migrate us from spreadsheets to a CRM?
Yes. We handle the data cleaning, migration, field mapping, and team training to get you off Excel and into a real system.

### Will automation make our sales feel robotic?
No. Good automation is invisible. We use personalization tokens and human-written templates so that automated emails feel like they were typed by hand.
