# Revenue Tech Stack

**Tools Don't Solve Problems. Systems DO.**

Buying a gym membership doesn't make you fit. Buying [**HubSpot**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/sales-automation/) doesn't get you customers. The modern [**GTM tech stack**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/full-stack/) is powerful but complex. We help you select the right tools, integrate them correctly, and ensure your team actually uses them.

## The Problem: Shelfware and Bloat

Most startups use 20% of the features in 100% of the tools they pay for. This "bloat" kills budget and confuses teams.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **"Shiny Object" Syndrome** | Buying every new AI tool that launches on Product Hunt. |
| **Lack of Ownership** | "Who owns the Apollo admin?" "I thought you did." |
| **Poor Integration** | Tools failing to pass data to each other, creating manual workarounds. |

**The reality:** A lean, well-integrated stack beats a bloated, expensive one every time.

## Our Technology Services

### 1. Audit & Consolidation
We look at your credit card statement and your usage logs.

**What We Build:**
- **Usage Analysis:** Identifying tools nobody has logged into for 30 days.
- **Redundancy checks:** "You're paying for ZoomInfo AND Apollo? Let's pick one."
- **Contract Negotiation:** Leveraging our partner status to get you better rates.

### 2. Implementation & Migration
We set up tools correctly from Day 1.

**What We Build:**
- **HubSpot Implementation:** Pipelines, properties, and permissions.
- **Clay Setup:** Workspace configuration and API connections.
- **Migration Services:** Moving data from Pipedrive/Close.io to HubSpot/Salesforce without data loss.

### 3. Custom Tooling & Scripts
Sometimes off-the-shelf isn't enough.

**What We Build:**
- **n8n / Zapier Workflows:** Connecting disconnected apps.
- **Custom Python Scripts:** Data scraping or formatting tasks.
- **API Connectors:** Custom bridges between your product database and your CRM.

## The Modern AI GTM Stack

Here is the standard "Best in Class" stack we recommend for 2026:

| Category | Tool Recommendation | Why? |
|----------|---------------------|------|
| **CRM** | **HubSpot** | The central nervous system. User-friendly and scalable. |
| **Enrichment** | **Clay** | The new standard for programmable data. |
| **Outbound Data** | **Apollo / Ocean.io** | Breadth of contact data. |
| **Sending** | **Smartlead / Instantly** | Deliverability and scaling. |
| **Intent** | **RB2B / Warmly** | Seeing who is on your site. |
| **AI** | **OpenAI / Claude** | Content generation and logic. |

---

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on our budget audits:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Tech Spend %** | <10% of total GTM budget |
| **Utilization Rate** | >80% of seats active daily |
| **Integration Score** | Tools connected via API, not CSV export |

If you are exporting CSVs to move data between tools, your stack is broken.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you get commissions on software?
We are partners with many tools (HubSpot, Clay, etc.) which means we sometimes get referral fees. However, we pass partner discounts to you whenever possible, and we never recommend a tool we don't use ourselves.

### Can I just use a spreadsheet?
For the first 10 customers? Yes. After that? No. You cannot scale a business on Google Sheets.

### Which CRM is best?
For 90% of B2B startups: **HubSpot**. It scales from free to enterprise. Salesforce is powerful but requires a full-time admin.
