# Full-Stack GTM Engineering

**A Complete Operating System for Revenue.**

Marketing, Sales, and Success are not separate departments—they are stages of a single revenue lifecycle. **Full-Stack GTM Engineering** integrates them into one cohesive machine. We don't just fix a leak; we rebuild the plumbing.

---

## The Problem: The "Frankenstein" Stack

Startups often buy tools in isolation: "Marketing bought [**HubSpot**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/tech-stack/), Sales bought Outreach, and nobody knows how to use [**Clay**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/outbound/)." The result is a fragmented mess where data dies in silos.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Siloed Data** | Marketing says "we sent 500 leads," Sales says "we got zero." Both are looking at different dashboards. |
| **Tool Overlap** | Paying for 3 different enrichment tools that do the same thing. |
| **Broken Handoffs** | Leads fall through the cracks between "MQL" and "SQL" because the systems aren't connected. |

**The reality:** You need an architect, not just a collection of contractors.

## Our Full-Stack Services

### 1. Unified Revenue Architecture
We design the blueprint for your entire customer journey.

**What We Build:**
- **Data Model Design:** Standardizing how "Lead," "Contact," and "Account" are defined across all systems.
- **Lifecycle Stages:** Automating the movement from Subscriber → Lead → MQL → SQL → Customer.
- **Attribution Modeling:** Tracking exactly which touchpoints (content, ads, outbound) drove the revenue.

### 2. End-to-End Integration
We connect the pipes.

**What We Build:**
- **Clay -> CRM Sync:** Real-time enrichment flowing into your system of record.
- **Intent -> Outreach Triggers:** Website visitors (RB2B) automatically triggering email sequences.
- **Product Usage -> CS Alerts:** Usage drops triggering churn-prevention tasks for Customer Success.

### 3. Revenue Operations (RevOps) as a Service
We manage the machine so you don't have to hire a full-time Ops person yet.

**What We Build:**
- **Weekly Reporting:** Truth-telling dashboards on pipeline health.
- **System Maintenance:** Fixing API breaks and updating workflows.
- **Quarterly Audits:** Consolidating tools to save budget.

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **CAC Payback Period** | How months it takes to earn back the cost of acquiring a customer. | Cash flow efficiency. |
| **Lead-to-Customer Rate** | Percentage of leads that end up paying. | Funnel quality. |
| **Revenue per Employee** | Total revenue divided by headcount. | Operational leverage. |
| **Tech Stack ROI** | Value generated vs. cost of tools. | Budget efficiency. |

---

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on efficient growth models:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **CAC Payback** | <12 months |
| **Net Dollar Retention** | >110% |
| **Marketing Contribution** | >40% of pipeline sourced by marketing |

If you can't measure these numbers today, your infrastructure is broken.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What constitutes a "stack"?
A standard modern GTM stack includes: A Data Source (Apollo/Clay), a CRM (HubSpot), an Outreach Tool (Smartlead), and an Analytics Layer (Factors/PostHog). We integrate them all.

### Is this a one-time project?
We offer both. We can do a **"Build"** project to set it up, or a **"Manage"** retainer to run it as your fractional RevOps team.

### How long does a full build take?
Typically 4-8 weeks to design, build, test, and deploy a complete GTM operating system.
