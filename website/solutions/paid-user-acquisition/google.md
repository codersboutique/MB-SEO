# Scientific Google Ads

**Search Intent Has Changed. Your Bidding Shouldn't.**

Most B2B Google Ads accounts are burning 40% of their budget on keywords that AI now answers for free. **Scientific Paid Search** focuses ruthlessly on high-intent, bottom-of-funnel queries where the user is ready to buy, not just learn.

## The Problem: The "Informational" Trap

Agencies love bidding on broad terms like "what is GTM" because they drive cheap clicks. But those users want a definition, not a demo. [**AI Overviews**](/solutions/aeo-geo/ai-search/) now satisfy that intent, meaning your ad gets ignored—or worse, clicked by a student.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Broad Match** | Google's "smart" bidding often matches your comprehensive software with "free template" searches. |
| **Vanilla Copy** | Ads that sound like everyone else ("Best GTM Tool") get filtered out by the brain. |
| **Broken Tracking** | Optimizing for "Page Views" instead of "Qualified Demos." |

**The reality:** You don't need more traffic. You need more intent.

## Our Google Ads Services

### 1. Intent Engineering
We bid only on commercial intent.

**What We Build:**
- **Negative Keyword Lists:** Extensive, shared lists of 2,000+ negative terms (free, jobs, template, definition) to block bad clicks.
- **Competitor Campaigns:** Bidding on your rivals' brand names with specific comparison assets.
- **SKAGs (Single Keyword Ad Groups):** Hyper-granular structure for maximum Quality Score.

### 2. Conversion Infrastructure
We make sure Google knows what a "good" lead is.

**What We Build:**
- **Offline Conversion Tracking (OCT):** Feeding Salesforce "Closed Won" data back into Google Ads to train the bidding algorithm.
- **Enhanced Conversions:** Using first-party data to recover lost tracking signal.
- **Deduplication:** Ensuring you aren't paying twice for the same lead.

### 3. Landing Page Engineering
The click is only half the battle.

**What We Build:**
- **Personalized LPs:** Pages that dynamically change headlines based on the keyword searched.
- **Speed Optimization:** Sub-second load times to improve Quality Score.
- **Offer Testing:** Testing "Book a Demo" vs "Watch a Tour" vs "Pricing Calculator."

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **ROAS** | Return on Ad Spend (Revenue / Cost). | The bottom line. |
| **Cost Per Qualified Lead (CPQL)** | Cost to get a lead that matches your ICP. | Quality over quantity. |
| **Quality Score** | Google's rating of your relevance (1-10). | Higher score = lower cost per click. |
| **Impression Share** | How often you show up for your best keywords. | Dominance. |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on B2B SaaS data:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | >5% (on landing pages) |
| **Cost Per Demo** | $150 - $400 (depending on ACV) |
| **Invalid Traffic** | <5% (aggressive blocking) |

If you are paying $20 for a "Lead" but $4,000 for a Demo, your funnel is leaky.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you use automated bidding?
Yes, but only *after* we have enough conversion data. We start with Manual CPC to control costs, then switch to Target CPA once the pixel is trained.

### How much budget do we need?
For B2B SaaS, we recommend a minimum of $3,000/month to get statistically significant data. Below that, learning takes too long.

### Do you handle Bing/Microsoft Ads?
Yes. For B2B, Microsoft Ads often has better demographics (older, wealthier, enterprise corporate devices) and lower CPCs.
