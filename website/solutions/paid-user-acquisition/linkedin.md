# LinkedIn Ads & Account-Based Marketing

**It's Not Social Media. It's a Sniper Rifle.**

LinkedIn is the only platform where you can guarantee your ad is seen by "CTOs at Series B AI companies with >50 employees." It is the most expensive traffic on the internet, which means you cannot afford to be boring or broad.

## The Problem: The "Audience Network" Waste

LinkedIn's default settings try to expand your audience to millions of people. This is how you burn budget.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Audience Expansion** | LinkedIn's "helpful" checkbox that shows your ad to "similar" people (who are rarely buyers). |
| **Boring Creative** | "We are excited to announce..." Corporate speak gets scrolled past instantly. |
| **Weak Offers** | Asking for a "Demo" from a cold audience is like proposing on the first date. |

**The reality:** Success on LinkedIn requires distinct creativity paired with rigid targeting engineering.

## Our LinkedIn Services

### 1. Tight-list Targeting (ABM)
We don't trust LinkedIn's native targeting alone.

**What We Build:**
- **Clay-to-Matched-Audience:** We build the perfect list in Clay (verified emails), and upload it to LinkedIn as a Matched Audience. 100% accuracy.
- **Account Disqualification:** ongoing exclusion of competitors, students, and bad-fit industries.
- **Tiered Campaigns:** Tier 1 (High bids for dream accounts) vs Tier 2 (Lower bids for broad ICP).

### 2. Thought Leader Ads
People trust people, not logos.

**What We Build:**
- **[Founder-Led Promotion](/solutions/product-content-marketing/linkedin/):** Promoting your founder's high-performing organic posts as ads.
- **Whitelisting:** Running ads from your happy customers' profiles (with permission).
- **Video Strategy:** Short, punchy videos that educate without sounding like a commercial.

### 3. The "95-5" Strategy
95% of your market isn't buying today. We nurture them until they are.

**What We Build:**
- **Education Layer:** Ungated content (cheat sheets, frameworks) to build trust/retargeting pools.
- **Capture Layer:** Direct response ads for the 5% ready to buy now.
- **Retargeting Loops:** Keeping your brand top-of-mind for 90 days after a website visit.

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Cost Per Account (CPA)** | Cost to engage a specific target company. | ABM efficiency. |
| **Engagement Rate** | Clicks + Likes + Comments / Impressions. | Creative resonance. |
| **Pipeline Influenced** | Deals that touched a LinkedIn ad before closing. | Multi-touch attribution. |
| **Frequency** | How often key decision makers see you. | Brand penetration (aiming for 3-5x/week). |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on ABM campaigns:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **CTR** | >0.5% (Benchmark is 0.35%) |
| **Cost Per Lead** | $50 - $150 (High quality) |
| **Video View Rate** | >25% completion |

If your CTR is below 0.3%, your creative is the problem. If it's high but no conversions, your offer is the problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is LinkedIn so expensive?
Because the data quality is unmatched. You pay a premium to ensure you aren't showing B2B software ads to retirees (like on Facebook).

### Can we target specific companies?
Yes. We can upload a list of exactly 100 companies you want to close and show ads *only* to their decision makers.

### What about text ads?
They are cheap and good for brand frequency, but rarely drive conversions. We use them for "air cover."
