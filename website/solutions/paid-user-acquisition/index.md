# Paid User Acquisition

**Scientific, Not Spray-and-Pray.**

Paid acquisition for AI startups isn't about throwing money at LinkedIn. It's about **surgical targeting**, rapid creative iteration, and tight feedback loops between ads and pipeline. We treat paid media as an engineering discipline.

Marketing Boutique builds paid acquisition systems that compound—not just spend budget.

## The Paid Acquisition Challenge for AI Startups

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| Broad LinkedIn targeting | CPMs are $50+; you're paying for non-buyers |
| Static creative | Ad fatigue kills performance in 1-2 weeks |
| Vanity metrics focus | Impressions don't pay salaries |
| Disconnected from sales | Leads generated but never contacted |

**The reality:** B2B paid acquisition is expensive. You can't afford to waste impressions on the wrong audience or measure success by clicks.
