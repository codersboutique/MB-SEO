# Paid User Acquisition

**Scientific, Not Spray-and-Pray.**

Paid acquisition for AI startups isn't about throwing money at LinkedIn. It's about **surgical targeting**, rapid creative iteration, and tight feedback loops between ads and pipeline. We treat paid media as an engineering discipline.

Marketing Boutique builds paid acquisition systems that compound—not just spend budget.

---

## The Paid Acquisition Challenge for AI Startups

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| Broad LinkedIn targeting | CPMs are $50+; you're paying for non-buyers |
| Static creative | Ad fatigue kills performance in 1-2 weeks |
| Vanity metrics focus | Impressions don't pay salaries |
| Disconnected from sales | Leads generated but never contacted |

**The reality:** B2B paid acquisition is expensive. You can't afford to waste impressions on the wrong audience or measure success by clicks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platform is best for B2B ads?
LinkedIn is best for precise targeting of decision-makers. Google is best for capturing high-intent search demand. Meta is powerful for retargeting and broad awareness at lower CPMs.

### What's a good B2B CAC?
A 'good' CAC depends on your ACV and LTV. Generally, we aim for a CAC payback period of <12 months. For enterprise SaaS, CAC can range from $500 to $5,000+ depending on deal size.
