# Meta Ads for B2B

**B2B Buyers Are People Too. They Have Instagram.**

The myth that "executives aren't on Facebook" is false. They are. And they are much cheaper to reach there than on LinkedIn. **Meta Ads** is your scale engine—using sophisticated algorithmic targeting to find B2B buyers based on their behavior, not just their job title.

## The Problem: The "B2C" Mindset

B2B companies often try to run "corporate" ads on Instagram. They look out of place and get ignored.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Stock Photos** | Use of generic "business handshake" stock photos screams "Ad" and triggers banner blindness. |
| **Over-Targeting** | Trying to restrict Meta's powerful algorithm with tight interest constraints (e.g., "Interested in SaaS"). |
| **One-and-Done** | Giving up after spending $500. Meta needs data to learn. |

**The reality:** To win on Meta, your creative needs to stop the scroll, and your pixel needs to be trained on meaningful events.

## Our Meta Services

Creative is the new targeting.

**What We Build:**
- **UGC (User Generated Content):** Lo-fi, authentic videos shot on iPhone that feel native to the feed.
- **Visual Hooks:** Testing 10 different opening 3-second hooks to see what grabs attention.
- **Static vs. Video:** Balancing high-performing static images (charts, memes) with explanatory video.

### 2. Algorithmic Training
We let the machine find the buyers.

**What We Build:**
- **Broad Targeting + CAPI:** Using broad audiences but feeding high-quality server-side conversion data (CAPI) back to Meta to train the model.
- **Lookalikes:** Building audiences based on your best customers (uploaded from [**Clay/HubSpot**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/tech-stack/)).
- **Retargeting Matrix:** Different ads for 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day visitors.

### 3. "Edutainment" Ads
Ads that teach, then sell.

**What We Build:**
- **Value-First Video:** 60-second clips that teach a concept or framework before asking for a click.
- **Carousel Walkthroughs:** Swipable guides that solve a specific problem.
- **Direct Offer Retargeting:** Harder hitting "Book a Demo" ads shown only to engaged users.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you target job titles on Facebook?
Not reliably. Meta removed most B2B targeting options. We rely on **Lookalikes** and **Creative Filtering** (writing the ad so only the right person would click).

### Is Instagram really for B2B?
Yes. Retargeting on Instagram Stories is one of the highest ROI channels for staying top-of-mind with prospects who visited your site.

### Do we need video?
Yes. Video accounts for >50% of time spent on platforms. Static images work, but video scales.
