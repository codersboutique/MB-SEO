# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

**Stop Chasing Clicks. Start Being the Answer.**

Search behavior has shifted. Users specifically ask questions, and AI provides the answers directly on the search results page. If you aren't the answer, you're invisible. **AEO** ensures your brand content is the source of truth that AI models cite.

## The Problem: Zero-Click Searches Are Dominating

Traditional [**SEO**](/solutions/aeo-geo/technical-seo/) focused on getting users to click a blue link. But with Google's [**AI Overviews**](/solutions/aeo-geo/ai-search/) and Featured Snippets, users are getting their answers without ever visiting a website.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Writing for "Word Count"** | AI models value information density, not fluff. Long, rambling posts get ignored. |
| **Burying the Lede** | If the answer isn't in the first 50 words, the AI engine moves on to a competitor. |
| **Ignoring Structure** | Unstructured text is hard for machines to parse. Without clear schema and hierarchy, you lose. |

**The reality:** 60% of searches now end without a click. You can't just rank; you must be the extracted answer.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between SEO and AEO?
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) focuses on ranking links to drive traffic to your site. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) focuses on formatting content so that search engines can extract the answer directly and present it to the user.

### Does AEO kill my website traffic?
No. While zero-click searches are rising, "click-through" traffic from AEO placements is often much higher intent. Users who click a citation are looking for deep expertise, not just a quick answer.

### How do you track AI Overview success?
We use advanced rank tracking tools designed for the new SERP features, monitoring not just rank position, but specific feature ownership like AI citations, snippet boxes, and knowledge panels.
