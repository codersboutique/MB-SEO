# Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Services

**If ChatGPT Doesn't Know You, You Don't Exist.**

The world's buyers are moving from Google to ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. Traditional [**SEO**](/solutions/aeo-geo/technical-seo/) doesn't work here. **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the strategic process of becoming a trusted, cited entity within Large Language Models (LLMs).

## The Problem: You Are Invisible to LLMs

Your website might rank on Google, but when a user asks ChatGPT "Who are the best GTM tools?", you aren't mentioned. Why? Because LLMs don't just "crawl" links—they "understand" entities.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Generic Content** | LLMs are trained on the internet. If you sound like everyone else, you are statistically insignificant. |
| **Lack of Citations** | LLMs trust what *others* say about you more than what you say about yourself. |
| **Brand Confusion** | If your positioning is inconsistent, the model hallucinates or ignores you. |

**The reality:** Being indexed is no longer enough. You must be *remembered* by the model.

## Our GEO Services

### 1. Citation Engineering
We strategically seed citations across the high-authority platforms that LLMs use as training data.

**What We Build:**
- **Digital PR Placement:** Getting your brand mentioned in "Best of" lists and industry reports.
- **Review Platform Strategy:** Optimizing your presence on G2, Capterra, and TrustRadius (major data sources for LLMs).
- **Video Transcripts:** Publishing high-quality transcripts, as models weigh spoken content heavily.

### 2. Information Gain & Original Research
We create content that adds *new* data to the internet, forcing LLMs to reference you as the primary source.

**What We Build:**
- **Proprietary Data Reports:** State of the industry surveys and benchmarks.
- **Unique Frameworks:** Naming your methodologies (e.g., "The Waterfall Enrichment Method") so models treat them as entities.
- **Expert Commentary:** Contrarian takes that differentiate you from the "average" consensus.

### 3. Context Engineering (llms.txt)
We optimize your site specifically for AI agent traversal.

**What We Build:**
- **llms.txt Implementation:** Creating the map that tells AI agents exactly what your site contains.
- **Brand Context Files:** Structured documents that define your company, products, and pricing for AI consumption.
- **API-First Content:** Ensuring your pricing and technical docs are machine-readable.

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Share of Model (SoM)** | How frequently your brand is mentioned when users ask category-defining questions. | Top-of-funnel awareness in the AI era. |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | The qualitative tone (positive/neutral/negative) of AI mentions. | Brand perception and trust. |
| **Citation Accuracy** | How accurately the model describes your value proposition. | Ensures qualified leads. |
| **Perplexity Referrals** | Traffic coming directly from answer engines like Perplexity. | High-intent, lower-funnel traffic. |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on our research into LLM behavior:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Brand Recognition** | 80% accuracy in description |
| **Category Association** | Mentioned in top 5 for category queries |
| **Review Velocity** | >5 new verifiable reviews/month |

If you aren't actively managing your entity reputation, the AI models are defining it for you—often incorrectly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you really "optimize" for ChatGPT?
Yes. While you can't edit the model's weights directly, you can influence the training data and the retrieval (RAG) sources it uses. By appearing in the trusted sources the model references, you increase the probability of citation.

### How is GEO different from AEO?
[**AEO**](/solutions/aeo-geo/aeo/) is about appearing in specifically formatted answer boxes (mostly Google). GEO is about being part of the generated narrative in conversational AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).

### How long does it take to see results?
Influencing LLMs is a longer game than traditional SEO. It typically takes 3-6 months to see significant shifts in "Share of Model" as training data updates and RAG sources are re-indexed.
