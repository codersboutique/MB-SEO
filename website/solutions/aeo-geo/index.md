# AEO & GEO: Dominate AI Search

**If the AI Doesn't Cite You, You Don't Exist.**

The mechanism of information retrieval is shifting. Buyers no longer browse ten blue links—they ask questions and receive synthesized answers. ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and SearchGPT are the new gatekeepers. If your brand is not in their citation list, you are invisible to the modern buyer.

Marketing Boutique specializes in **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**—the discipline of ensuring your brand is cited when AI answers questions in your category.

---

## The Paradigm Shift: From Traffic to Citation

| Feature | Traditional SEO (2010-2024) | Generative Authority (2025+) |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Primary Metric** | Organic Traffic / CTR | Share of Model / Citation Frequency |
| **Optimization Target** | Keywords & Backlinks | Entities & Information Gain |
| **User Behavior** | Navigation (Searching for links) | Interrogation (Asking for answers) |
| **Content Strategy** | Long-form "Ultimate Guides" | Structured Data & Proprietary Facts |
| **Trust Signal** | Domain Authority (DA) | E-E-A-T & Verification |

**The implication:** Visibility is no longer about traffic; it is about **inclusion**. If a startup is not cited by the AI as a solution to a problem, it effectively does not exist in the consideration set.

---

## AEO vs. GEO: Understanding the Difference

### Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)
AEO focuses on structuring content to provide direct answers to user queries. The goal is to capture the "zero-click" search result—the Featured Snippet or AI Overview that answers the question without requiring a click.

**AEO Tactics:**
- Q&A block formatting optimized for NLP extraction.
- Direct answer sentences (40-60 words) at the top of content.
- FAQ schema markup for structured data extraction.

### Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)
GEO is about ensuring your brand is cited by Large Language Models when they synthesize answers. This requires building "Entity Authority"—establishing your brand as a trusted node in the AI's knowledge graph.

**GEO Tactics:**
- Knowledge Graph presence (Wikidata, Crunchbase, Google Knowledge Panel).
- Citation engineering—placement on high-authority sites that LLMs trust.
- Technical machine readability (llms.txt, semantic HTML, Markdown tables).

- **Technical Documentation:** Engineering logs, architectural decisions, and detailed how-tos.
- **First-Party Data:** Unique insights from your product usage that no competitor can replicate.
