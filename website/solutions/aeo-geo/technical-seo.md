# Technical SEO for AI

**Robots Read Code, Not Pixels.**

Your beautiful React website might be completely invisible to AI agents. Traditional technical SEO focused on load speed and mobile responsiveness. **Technical SEO for AI** focuses on crawlability, semantic structure, and machine-readability. We build the infrastructure that lets robots understand your business.

## The Problem: The "Black Box" Website

Modern web frameworks (React, Next.js, Vue) often serve empty HTML shells that require JavaScript to render. While Google can render JS, many AI scrapers and [**AEO**](/solutions/aeo-geo/aeo/) bots cannot.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Client-Side Rendering** | Bots see a blank page. If they can't see the text, they can't index it. |
| **Missing Schema** | Without structured data, your pricing, reviews, and events are just unstructured text strings. |
| **Bloated DOM** | Excessive code makes it expensive and slow for bots to parse your content. |

**The reality:** If your content isn't delivered in a clean, raw format, you are blocking the very AI agents trying to promote you.

## Our Technical Services

### 1. AI-First Infrastructure
We ensure your site is perfectly accessible to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google crawlers.

**What We Build:**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Ensuring complete HTML is delivered instantly to bots.
- **llms.txt Implementation:** A standardized file for giving AI agents a "menu" of your content.
- **Dynamic Sitemaps:** Real-time updating sitemaps that prioritize high-value pages.

### 2. Advanced Schema Architecture
We speak the native language of search engines: JSON-LD.

**What We Build:**
- **Service & Product Schema:** Marking up your offerings with price, currency, and availability.
- **Organization & Person Schema:** clearly defining your brand entity and leadership team.
- **Breadcrumb & Navigation Schema:** Helping bots understand your site structure.

### 3. Core Web Vitals & Speed
Speed isn't just for users; it's for crawl budget. Slow sites get crawled less often.

**What We Build:**
- **Code Minification & Optimization:** Stripping unused CSS/JS to reduce payload.
- **Image Optimization:** Next-gen formats (WebP/AVIF) and lazy loading.
- **Caching Strategy:** Edge caching to deliver content in milliseconds globally.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need an llms.txt file?
Yes. It is becoming the standard for how AI agents discover and consume content. It's a low-effort, high-reward signal that you are "AI-ready."

### Does this replace my current developer team?
No, we work *with* your developers. We provide the specifications, code snippets, and acceptance criteria. We are the architects; your team can be the builders, or we can implement it directly.

### How often should we audit technical SEO?
For active sites, we recommend a quarterly deep dive. For sites shipping code daily, automated monitoring should be continuous.
