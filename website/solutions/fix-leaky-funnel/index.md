# Fix Your Leaky Funnel

**You're Acquiring Leads. You're Not Converting Them.**

Every startup has funnel leakage. Visitors bounce. Demos no-show. Trials don't convert. Pipeline stalls. The question is: do you know *where* you're leaking, and do you have the infrastructure to plug the holes?

Marketing Boutique provides systematic funnel diagnostics and builds the automation infrastructure to maximize conversion at every stage.

## The Funnel Leakage Problem

For AI startups, the typical leakage points are:

| Funnel Stage | Common Leak | Symptom |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Top of Funnel** | Poor landing page alignment | High bounce rate, low form fills |
| **Middle of Funnel** | No nurture sequences | Demos requested but not booked |
| **Bottom of Funnel** | Weak follow-up | Proposals sent, no response |
| **Post-Sale** | Poor onboarding | Trial-to-paid conversion below benchmark |

**The cost of leakage:** If your CAC is $500 and 50% of qualified leads leak, you're effectively paying $1,000 per customer.
