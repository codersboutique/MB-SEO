# Product-Led Content & SEO

**Blog Posts Are Dead. Content Products Are Alive.**

The era of 500-word "What is X" articles is over. [**AI**](/solutions/aeo-geo/ai-search/) answers those instantly. To win today, your content must be a product in itself—solving a problem, providing a tool, or offering a unique framework that AI cannot hallucinate.

## The Problem: The "SEO Ghetto"

Most companies build a "blog" that sits in a silo, completely disconnected from their product. They optimize for traffic, not users.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Top-of-Funnel Only** | Getting 10,000 visitors to a "trends" article who never pretend to buy your software. |
| **Zero Product Tie-in** | Mentioning your product only in the CTA at the bottom. |
| **AI Slop** | Publishing hundreds of AI-generated articles hoping one sticks. Google is de-indexing this daily. |

**The reality:** Traffic is a vanity metric. If your content doesn't lead to a signup, it's a waste of server space.

## Our Content Services

### 1. Product-Led Content (PLC)
We weave your product into the narrative.

**What We Build:**
- **"How-to" Guides:** Teaching users how to solve a problem *using* your product as the vehicle.
- **Template Libraries:** Giving away free Notion/Excel templates that upsell to your software.
- **Comparison Pages:** Honest "Us vs. Them" pages that rank for high-intent queries (e.g., "Competitor Alternative").

### 2. High-Utility Assets
Content that feels like software.

**What We Build:**
- **Calculators:** "ROI Calculator" or "Pricing Estimator" pages that capture leads.
- **Tools:** Free, lightweight tools (e.g., "Subject Line Tester") that act as lead magnets.
- **Glossaries:** Definitive, technical glossaries that capture definition traffic from developers.

### 3. Content Refresh Engine
Decay is real. We fight it.

**What We Build:**
- **Update Cadence:** Systematically updating top pages every 90 days to keep them "Fresh" in Google's eyes.
- **Conversion Optimization (CRO):** Testing new CTAs and offers on high-traffic pages.
- **De-indexing:** Pruning low-quality content that drags down your site authority.

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Signups from Content** | Users who read a post and immediately create an account. | The holy grail. |
| **Assisted Conversions** | Users who read content and converted later (tracked via attribution). | Influence. |
| **Time on Page** | Engagement depth. | Signal of quality to Google. |
| **Brand Search Volume** | Growth in people searching for your company name. | Signal of authority. |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on efficient PLG models:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | >1.5% (Visitor to Signup) |
| **Organic Traffic** | >20% MoM growth |
| **Content Contribution** | >30% of total signups |

If your blog converts at 0.1%, you are running a magazine, not a business.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you use AI to write?
We use AI for research, outlining, and "first draft" velocity. But 100% of our published content is human-edited, fact-checked, and infused with your unique point of view.

### How many posts per month?
Quality > Quantity. We typically produce 4 "Deep Dives" (2,000+ words) and 8 "sniper" updates per month.

### Do we need a blog?
You need a library. Whether you call it a blog, a resource center, or an academy—you need a place to house your knowledge.
