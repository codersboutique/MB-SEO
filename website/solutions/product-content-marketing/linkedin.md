# Founder Brand & LinkedIn

**Founders Are the New Media Companies.**

People buy from people. In the AI era, trust in corporate logos is at an all-time low. Trust in authentic, visible founders is at an all-time high. A strong **Founder Brand** is the highest-leverage asset a startup can build—reducing CAC, attracting talent, and opening doors that ads cannot.

## The Problem: The "Ghostwriter" Cringe

Most founders know they should be on [**LinkedIn**](/solutions/paid-user-acquisition/linkedin/), but they either don't have time, or they hire cheap ghostwriters who sound like ChatGPT.

| Common Mistake | Why It Fails |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Platitudes** | "Leadership is about serving others." (Boring, generic, zero signal). |
| **Humble-brags** | "So humbled to be announced as..." (Triggers eye-rolls). |
| **Inconsistency** | Posting 5 times one week, then disappearing for a month. Algorithms punish this. |

**The reality:** You don't need to be an "influencer." You need to be a **Subject Matter Expert**.

## Our Branding Services

### 1. The Interview-to-Content Pipeline
We extract your genius without taking your time.

**What We Build:**
- **30-Minute Interviews:** We interview you once a week on specific, technical topics.
- **Content Splintering:** We turn that one call into 5 LinkedIn posts, 2 newsletters, and a Twitter thread.
- **Voice Calibration:** We train our writers on your specific idioms, tone, and beliefs until you can't tell the difference.

### 2. Point-of-View (POV) Development
We help you figure out what you actually stand for.

**What We Build:**
- **The "Enemy" Definition:** Who or what are you fighting against? (e.g., "Manual data entry," "Bloated agencies").
- **Framework Naming:** Giving sticky names to your unique concepts (e.g., "The 95-5 Rule").
- **Story Mining:** Extracting lessons from your past experiences to build narrative connection.

### 3. Engagement Engineering
Posting is only 20% of the work.

**What We Build:**
- **Comment Strategy:** Engaging with other [**thought leaders**](/solutions/product-content-marketing/thought-leadership/) in your niche to borrow their audience.
- **DM Nurture:** Moving conversations from the comments to the DMs (without being salesy).
- **Network Growth:** Systematically connecting with your ICP.

## Key Metrics We Impact

| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| **Profile Views** | How many people checked out your profile (and your bio link). | Top of funnel. |
| **Inbound DMs** | "Hey, saw your post..." messages. | Pipeline. |
| **Connection Acceptance** | Percentage of people who accept your invite. | Authority signal. |
| **Content Reshares** | Viral coeffecient. | Reach. |

## Benchmarks for AI Startups

Based on founder profiles we manage:

| Metric | Healthy Benchmark |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Impressions/Post** | >1,000 |
| **Engagement Rate** | >1.5% |
| **Inbound Leads** | >3-5 qualified leads/month per profile |

If you are posting daily and getting zero leads, you are "posting," not "building."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this ghostwriting?
We prefer "Ghost-Thinking." You provide the thoughts; we provide the polish and distribution. We never publish anything without your approval.

### Do I have to post personal stuff?
No. You are building a *professional* brand. We focus on your expertise, your product, and your industry observations. No "what I ate for breakfast" posts.

### Can you manage multiple profiles?
Yes. We often run "Team Branding" programs for the CEO, CTO, and Head of Sales simultaneously.
