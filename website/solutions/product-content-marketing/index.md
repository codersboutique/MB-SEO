# Product Content Marketing

**Content That Drives Adoption, Not Just Views.**

AI startups don't need more blog posts. They need content that demonstrates product value, reduces support burden, and converts readers into users. Generic "thought leadership" is noise. **Product-led content** is the signal.

Marketing Boutique builds content engines that tie directly to your product—solving user problems *using* your product.

## The Content Problem for AI Startups

| Traditional Content | Product-Led Content |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| "10 Tips for Better Marketing" | "How to Automate Lead Enrichment with [Product]" |
| Brand awareness | Conversion intent |
| Vanity metrics (views) | Pipeline metrics (signups, trials) |
| Disconnected from product | Embedded product education |

**The insight:** Your product is your best content. The content strategy should make the product the hero.

## The Barbell Content Strategy

We recommend a **Barbell Strategy** for content distribution:

| Content Type | Allocation | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Technical/Product-Led** | 80% | High-intent, conversion-focused. Targets GTM Engineers, CTOs, practitioners. |
| **Buzzworthy/Opinionated** | 20% | High-reach, debate-generating. Builds backlinks and social shares. |

This approach builds domain authority (through viral opinionated pieces) while driving conversions (through technical product content).

---

## Content Distribution: LinkedIn Engine

For B2B AI startups, LinkedIn is the distribution channel that matters most.

**What We Build:**
- **Founder LinkedIn Strategy:** Profile optimization, content calendar, engagement tactics.
- **Employee Advocacy Program:** Systems to amplify content through your team.
- **Repurposing Workflow:** Blog → LinkedIn posts → Twitter threads → Newsletter.

## Key Metrics for Product Content

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Content-Sourced Signups** | Trials/signups from content pages | Direct conversion impact |
| **Feature Page Traffic** | Views to product-specific pages | Product awareness |
| **Docs Engagement** | Time on docs, page depth | User activation correlation |
| **Organic Keyword Coverage** | % of target keywords ranking | SEO progress |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### We already have a blog. What's different?
Most blogs produce content for "thought leadership"—vague, unfocused, and disconnected from the product. We restructure your content around product use cases and conversion intent.

### How do you handle technical accuracy?
We pair content strategists with technical reviewers. For highly technical content (API docs, engineering tutorials), we work with your engineering team or use subject matter experts.

### What's the timeline for pSEO?
Programmatic SEO page templates take 4-6 weeks to develop. Depending on your data, we can launch hundreds to thousands of pages within 8 weeks.
