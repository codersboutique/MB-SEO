# Google Business Profile Optimization

**Your GBP is the Foundation of AI Local Visibility.**

Google Business Profile is not just a listing—it's the primary data source for Google's AI local recommendations. Gemini Local, Google AI Overviews, and Google Assistant all pull from your GBP to answer local queries.

An incomplete or stale profile tells AI: "This business might be closed."

We build and maintain GBP profiles that AI trusts.

## Why GBP is Non-Negotiable

| Profile Element | Impact on AI Visibility |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Complete Profile** | 2.7x more likely to be considered reputable by AI |
| **Weekly Posts** | Signals active, operating business |
| **Q&A Section** | Provides AI with FAQ-style data for conversational queries |
| **Photos (recent)** | Visual verification of business legitimacy |
| **Accurate Hours** | Prevents AI from recommending when you're closed |
| **Service Catalog** | Tells AI exactly what you offer |
