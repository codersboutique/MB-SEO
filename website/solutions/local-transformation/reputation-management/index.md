# Reputation Management

**AI Reads Your Reviews. Every. Single. Word.**

Star ratings are the old metric. In 2026, AI systems perform **sentiment analysis** on your reviews to understand exactly what you're good at—and what you're not. A review that says "Fixed my AC fast on a Sunday" tells AI you do emergency HVAC work.

We build the review ecosystem that makes AI confident in recommending you.

## Why Reviews Matter More Than Ever

| Old Model (2015-2024) | New Model (2025+) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Star rating (4.5+) is enough | AI reads full review text |
| Quantity matters | Quality + recency + specificity matters |
| Reviews are social proof | Reviews are AI training data |
| Response optional | Response demonstrates engagement |

**The AI Reality:** When a user asks "Find a plumber who does trenchless sewer repair," AI scans reviews mentioning "trenchless" and evaluates sentiment. If you have those reviews, you get recommended. If not, you're invisible.

## Our Reputation Management System

### 1. Automated Review Solicitation
We build review collection into your existing workflow.

**How It Works:**
1. Customer completes service (triggers from CRM/scheduler)
2. SMS/email sent within 2 hours (optimal timing)
3. Direct link to preferred review platform (Google, Yelp, industry-specific)
4. Follow-up sequence for non-responders

**Results:** Our clients see 3-5x increase in review volume within 90 days.

### 2. AI-Assisted Response Management
Every review gets a response. We make it effortless.

**How It Works:**
1. AI drafts personalized response based on review content
2. You approve or edit via simple dashboard
3. Response posted within 24 hours

**Why It Matters:** Response rates signal to AI that you're an engaged, active business.

### 3. Sentiment Monitoring & Alerts
We track the words customers use—not just the stars.

**What We Monitor:**
- Service-specific mentions (what do customers praise?)
- Pain points and complaints (what needs improvement?)
- Competitor mentions (what are customers comparing you to?)
- Trending topics (what's on customers' minds?)

### 4. Multi-Platform Coverage
We don't just focus on Google:

- [**Google Business Profile**](/solutions/local-transformation/gbp-optimization/) — Primary AI data source
- **Yelp** — Critical for certain industries
- **Facebook** — Social validation
- **Industry Directories** — Healthgrades, Avvo, HomeAdvisor, Capterra, etc.

## The Review Quality Framework

Not all reviews are equal. Here's what AI values:

| Factor | Low Value | High Value |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Specificity** | "Great service!" | "Fixed our furnace same-day when it was 30 degrees outside" |
| **Recency** | 6+ months old | Within 30 days |
| **Length** | One sentence | 50-100 words with detail |
| **Service Mention** | Generic praise | Names specific service (e.g., "water heater installation") |
| **Response** | No business response | Personalized response within 24hrs |

**Our Goal:** Help you generate high-value reviews that serve as training data for AI recommendations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do reviews matter for AI recommendations?
AI systems read the full text of reviews—not just star ratings—to understand what services you excel at and whether you're trustworthy. Sentiment analysis from reviews directly influences AI recommendation decisions. A review mentioning "emergency AC repair" teaches AI to recommend you for that query.

### How do you automate review collection?
We integrate with your CRM or scheduling software to trigger SMS/email review requests after service completion. Timing (2-4 hours post-service) and personalization are optimized to maximize response rates.

### Do you write fake reviews?
Absolutely not. We automate the *solicitation* of real reviews from real customers. Fake reviews violate platform policies and destroy trust—the opposite of what AI-ready marketing requires.
