# Seed Stage: The Builder

**Finding Product-Market Fit. Acquiring Your First 100 Customers.**

At the Seed stage, your priority is not scale—it is **validation**. You need to prove that a repeatable, defensible market exists for your product. This is not the time for broad campaigns; it is the time for surgical, high-signal experimentation.

Marketing Boutique helps Seed-stage AI startups build the foundational GTM infrastructure that generates the data you need to prove PMF and close your Series A.

## The Seed Stage Challenge

Seed-stage startups face a unique set of constraints:
- **Limited runway:** Every dollar must generate learning or revenue.
- **No brand authority:** You cannot rely on inbound demand.
- **Unproven ICP:** Your ideal customer profile is a hypothesis, not a fact.

Traditional marketing agencies will burn your capital on "brand awareness" campaigns. We build **lean, automated systems** that generate high-quality signals.

## Our Seed Stage Solutions

### 1. Founder-Led Sales Infrastructure
Before you can hire a sales team, the founder must close deals. We build the infrastructure to make this efficient.

**What We Build:**
- **Targeted Outbound Sequences:** Using Clay enrichment and AI-personalized email drafts.
- **CRM Architecture:** A lightweight HubSpot or Attio setup designed for founder-led velocity.
- **Meeting Scheduler Automation:** Calendly + Slack triggers for instant team notification.

### 2. ICP Validation Engine
Your initial assumptions about your Ideal Customer Profile are wrong. We build systems to rapidly test and refine.

**What We Build:**
- **Signal-Based Prospecting:** Monitoring for "buying signals" (e.g., new funding rounds, specific job postings, tech stack changes).
- **Cohort Analysis Pipelines:** Tracking which segments convert and retain.
- **Feedback Loops:** Automated systems that capture sales call notes and synthesize patterns.

### 3. Minimum Viable Authority (MVA)
You need enough online presence for prospects to trust you. We create the essentials without over-investing.

**What We Build:**
- **Foundational Schema Markup:** Organization schema, social proof integration.
- **Core "About" and "How It Works" Pages:** Concise, conversion-focused copy.
- **LinkedIn Thought Leadership Setup:** Profile optimization and an initial content calendar for the founder.
