# Dominate AI Search

**Be the Answer, Not Just a Link.**

When your target buyer asks an AI assistant for a solution, will your company be in the response? The majority of AI-generated answers cite only 3-5 sources. If you're not one of them, you're invisible.

Marketing Boutique helps AI startups achieve **Generative Authority**—the state where AI models consistently cite and recommend your brand. Learn more about our comprehensive [AEO & GEO services](/solutions/aeo-geo/).

## The AI Search Landscape in 2026

| Platform | Monthly Users | Citation Style |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **ChatGPT** | 200M+ | Synthesized answers with web citations |
| **Perplexity** | 50M+ | Research-style answers with numbered sources |
| **Google AI Overviews** | 1B+ | Top-of-SERP synthesized summaries |
| **SearchGPT** | Growing | Conversational search with inline citations |

**The implication:** Your buyer's first touchpoint with your brand may be an AI quoting you—not your website, not your ad, not your content. You need to control that narrative.

## Our AI Search Domination Strategy

### 1. Entity Establishment
You must exist in the AI's world model as a recognized entity.

**What We Do:**
- Create and verify [**Wikidata**](/solutions/aeo-geo/aeo/) entries for your company and key executives.
- Optimize **Google Knowledge Panel** with official information.
- Build entity associations with industry leaders and category terms.

### 2. Become a Cited Source
LLMs cite sources they trust. We make you trustworthy.

**What We Do:**
- Place your brand in **seed publications** that AI models use for training and RAG.
- Generate **original research** and proprietary data that becomes the primary source.
- Build **backlink authority** from .edu, .gov, and industry body domains.

### 3. Optimize for Retrieval
AI crawlers need to efficiently parse and retrieve your content.

**What We Do:**
- Implement [**llms.txt**](/solutions/aeo-geo/technical-seo/)—a manifest file that guides AI crawlers.
- Structure content with **semantic HTML** and Markdown tables.
- Break content into **chunk-optimized sections** that fit RAG retrieval windows.

### 4. Monitor and Iterate
AI search is dynamic. We track your visibility and adapt.

**What We Do:**
- Use tools like **Profound** and **Visibility** to track citation frequency.
- A/B test content structures to improve retrieval rates.
- Monitor competitor visibility and identify gaps to exploit.

## What It Takes to Rank in AI Search

Based on our research, AI models prioritize:

1. **Entity Authority:** Is your brand a recognized entity in the Knowledge Graph?
2. **Information Gain:** Does your content provide novel, non-redundant information?
3. **E-E-A-T Signals:** Is the content authored by verified experts?
4. **Technical Legibility:** Can the crawler efficiently parse your site?
5. **Recency:** Is the information current and regularly updated?

We optimize for all five factors systematically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from traditional SEO?
Traditional SEO optimizes for ranking in link-based search results. GEO optimizes for being cited in AI-generated answers. The tactics overlap (good content, authority signals) but the implementation details differ significantly—especially around entity establishment and content structure.

### Can you guarantee we'll be cited by ChatGPT?
No one can guarantee specific AI citations. What we guarantee is implementing best practices that maximize your probability of being cited, based on empirical research into how LLMs select sources.

### How do you measure AI search visibility?
We use specialized tools that track citation frequency across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. We also monitor Knowledge Panel status and entity graph presence.

### What's the timeline for results?
Entity establishment takes 4-8 weeks. Improved citation visibility typically appears within 2-3 months as new content is indexed and authority signals propagate.
