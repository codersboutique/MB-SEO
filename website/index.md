# We Engineer Revenue for AI-Native Startups

**Marketing Boutique** is not a marketing agency. We are **GTM Engineers**. We design and build the automated revenue infrastructure that allows AI-native B2B companies to scale from Seed to Series A and beyond.

The era of "campaigns" is over. In 2026, growth is about **architecture**—data pipelines, API integrations, and algorithmic authority. If your marketing stack requires manual labor to function, you are already behind.

## The Generative Authority Framework (GAF)

Our proprietary methodology ensures your brand is not just visible on Google, but **cited by AI**. When a buyer asks ChatGPT, Perplexity, or SearchGPT for a solution, you need to be the answer.

### Pillar 1: Entity-First Architecture
We establish your company as a **Knowledge Graph entity**. Through Wikidata entries, Knowledge Panels, and semantic markup, we train AI models to recognize your brand as a distinct, authoritative concept.

### Pillar 2: The Information Gain Protocol
AI models prioritize **novel information**. We pivot your content from opinion to proprietary data—original research, technical whitepapers, and engineering documentation that LLMs are trained to cite.

### Pillar 3: Technical Machine Readability
Your website must be optimized for the **non-human user**. We implement `llms.txt`, semantic HTML, and Markdown-first formatting to ensure AI crawlers can efficiently parse and retrieve your content.

### Pillar 4: The Trust Layer (E-E-A-T)
In an era of AI-generated noise, **trust is the filter**. We establish radical transparency through authorship attribution, AI disclosure statements, and a strategy for referential authority (citations from .edu and industry bodies).

## The Agency for the "Supernova" Startup

Bessemer Venture Partners defines "Supernova" companies as those with explosively scaling ARR. These companies cannot afford "shelfware" marketing. They require a partner who speaks the language of APIs, webhooks, and latency.

**That's us.**

We view marketing as a system to be optimized, not a creative endeavor. Our team is composed of engineers, data scientists, and GTM specialists—not just marketers.

We start every engagement with a **Deep Audit**—a standalone product that assesses your GTM stack, GEO visibility, and revenue architecture.
