# About Marketing Boutique

**We're Not a Marketing Agency. We're GTM Engineers.**

Marketing Boutique was founded on a simple observation: AI-native startups don't need more campaigns—they need [**revenue infrastructure**](/solutions/gtm-engineering/full-stack/). They need partners who speak the language of APIs, data pipelines, and automation, not just creative briefs and brand guidelines.

We bridge the gap between marketing strategy and technical execution.

## Our Philosophy

### Marketing is an Engineering Discipline

For AI startups, growth is a system to be designed, not an art to be practiced. We approach marketing with the same rigor that engineers apply to building products:

- **Measure everything.** Opinions are worthless without data.
- **Automate repetitiously.** If a human does it more than twice, it should be automated.
- **Build infrastructure, not campaigns.** Campaigns end. Infrastructure compounds.

### The "Agency" Model is Broken

Traditional agencies:
- Charge by the hour (misaligned incentives)
- Produce "deliverables" disconnected from revenue
- Staff with generalists who don't understand your stack
- Measure vanity metrics (impressions, reach)

We do the opposite.

### We're a Partner, Not a Vendor

We embed with your team. We share your Slack. We attend your pipeline reviews. Our success is measured by your outcomes.

## What We Believe

**Generative Authority is the Future.**
In a world where AI answers questions, the winners are the brands that get cited. We invest heavily in understanding how LLMs retrieve and synthesize information.

**Unit Economics > Growth at All Costs.**
We help startups build efficient growth engines. The era of "burn to grow" is over.

**Infrastructure > Campaigns.**
We build systems that work while you sleep. The value compounds.

**Data > Opinion.**
Every decision backed by evidence. We test, measure, and iterate.

---

## Our Team

We're a hybrid team of marketers, engineers, and data specialists:

- **Growth Engineers:** Build automations, integrations, and data pipelines.
- **Revenue Strategists:** Design GTM motions and pricing models.
- **Content Specialists:** Create product-led, citation-worthy content.
- **Data Analysts:** Track, attribute, and optimize.

We're small by design. Every client gets senior attention.

---

## Our Clients

We work exclusively with AI-native B2B startups:

- **Stage:** Seed to Series B (post-PMF)
- **Model:** Usage-based or consumption pricing preferred
- **Profile:** Engineering-led, growth-focused, data-driven
- **Geography:** Global (remote-first)

If you're building AI infrastructure, dev tools, data platforms, or enterprise AI applications—we understand your world.

## How We Work

### The Audit
Every engagement starts with a Deep Audit—an assessment of your GTM stack, GEO visibility, and revenue architecture. This is a standalone product.

### The Build
We design and implement the infrastructure: enrichment pipelines, CRM architecture, content systems, attribution models.

### The Optimize
We monitor, iterate, and improve. Monthly reviews. Quarterly planning. Continuous optimization.
