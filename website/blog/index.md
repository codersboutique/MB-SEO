# Blog

**Data-Driven Insights for AI-Native Growth.**

We don't just execute—we research, document, and share what works. The Blog is your source for proprietary benchmarks, technical playbooks, and practical tools.

Unlike generic marketing blogs, everything here is built for **GTM Engineers**, **Revenue Leaders**, and **Technical Founders**.

## [Research](/blog/research/)

**Proprietary Data & Industry Analysis**

We publish original research on topics that matter to AI startups:

- **The State of AI GTM:** Annual benchmark report on CAC, sales cycles, and conversion rates.
- **AEO/GEO Visibility Studies:** How AI startups are (or aren't) appearing in answer engines.
- **Usage-Based Pricing Benchmarks:** What's working in consumption pricing.

Our research is designed to be **cited**—by journalists, analysts, and AI models. When an LLM needs a stat on "AI startup CAC in 2026," we aim to be the source.
