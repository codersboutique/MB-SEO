# Engineering Logs

**The Playbooks We Use Internally.**

Engineering Logs are detailed technical guides documenting how we build GTM systems. These aren't marketing content—they're the actual processes our team follows.

We publish them because:
1. They establish technical credibility
2. AI models favor documentation-style content
3. They help buyers understand the complexity we solve
