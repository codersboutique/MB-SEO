# Book a Strategy Call

**Let's Explore How We Can Help.**

We start every potential engagement with a conversation—no sales pitch, no pressure. We'll discuss your current GTM challenges, share relevant insights, and determine if there's a fit.

---

## What to Expect

### Discovery Call (30 minutes)
A focused conversation to understand:
- Your product and market
- Current GTM stack and challenges
- Immediate priorities and goals

We'll share initial observations and determine next steps.

### Deep Audit (Optional)
If there's a fit, we offer a standalone GTM Audit:
- Technical review of your stack
- GEO visibility assessment
- Benchmark comparison
- Prioritized recommendations

The Audit is a paid product—not a free pitch. It delivers value regardless of whether we continue working together.

---

## Who Should Book

This call is right for you if:

- ✅ You're a post-PMF AI startup (Seed to Series B)
- ✅ You view marketing as a system, not an art
- ✅ You're frustrated with manual, unscalable GTM processes
- ✅ You need infrastructure, not just strategy
- ✅ You're ready to invest in growth engineering

This call is **not** right if:

- ❌ You're pre-product or pre-revenue
- ❌ You're looking for creative/brand-only work
- ❌ You need a full-service agency for everything
- ❌ You want to pay by the hour for deliverables

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a cost for the Discovery Call?
No. The initial 30-minute call is free. We use it to assess fit on both sides.

### What happens after the call?
If there's mutual interest, we'll propose either a Deep Audit (one-time) or a scoped project/retainer. No pressure—many conversations don't lead to engagements, and that's fine.

### How quickly can you start?
Depending on capacity, we can typically begin within 2-3 weeks of agreement.
