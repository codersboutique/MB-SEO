# Part 3: Authority & Citation Plan (LLM Influence)

## Understanding How LLMs Select Sources

| Factor | Priority | Optimization Strategy |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **Information Density** | High | Pack articles with data, definitions, comparisons |
| **Authoritative Citations** | High | Reference industry studies, link to credible sources |

[topic] focuses on [key differentiator].

### Key Components of [Topic]:
1. **Component A** - [Brief explanation]
2. **Component B** - [Brief explanation]
3. **Component C** - [Brief explanation]

### [Topic] vs [Alternative] Comparison:

| Factor | [Topic] | [Alternative] |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Focus | X | Y |
| Outcome | X | Y |
```

### Priority Topics to "Own" in AI:

1. **GTM Engineering** (Emerging term, low competition)
2. **Answer Engine Optimization** (First-mover opportunity)
